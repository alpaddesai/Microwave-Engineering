For analog RF systems noise is additive for cascaded analog systems hence each block must be allocated a gain and noise figure to reduce the noise on the whole subsystem. Common noise types are thermal (johnson or white is independent of f ) noise, shot noise (guassian white process) and flicker noise  . For the data acquisition system the major noise is the quantization noise. GSM and 802.11g require an overall noise figure to be around 10dB and WideMedia requires a noise figure of 6.6dB and for 3G standards a noise figure of 5dB is recommended."/>

A high sensitivity requires a high gain around 100 to 120dB to resotre the received signal to its original baseband level.
